### Overview

The packages in this folder are published to the public npm registry to be used for tests. 

The packages should **not** be published using an Axway/Appcelerator account, only a personal account. This is to avoid accidental ingestion into the production package registry. Contact Ewan Harris if you need access.

Below is a list of the packages, what they are and what purpose they serve.
